## Team Members:
Lolita Dias, Irais Garcia, Marc Omar Haddid, Nithin Sunil

## Dataset:

The data set was downloaded from Kaggle

## About the dataset:

Dataset of all of the crimes in the DC metro police system ranging from Theft, Arson, Assault, Homicide, Sex Abuse, Robbery, and Burglary.Data can be easily geocoded and mapped, trends can be extracted, and predictions can be made.

Raw Data can be accessed from: http://crimemap.dc.gov/CrimeMapSearch.aspx#tabs-GeoOther

The data is most easily accessed by downloading 1 ward at a time for the specific data range.

## Tasks:

Created scripts to analyse the crime data and answer the following questions:

1. Outliers in the dataset.

4. Total Number of Crimes by Year
5. Total Number of Crimes by Month
6. Total Number of Crimes by Day of the Week
